## Writeup
In the `inhere` directory, there are multiple files with dashed filenames. Using the command `file ./file*`, we can use a wildcard to list the file types of all the dashed files in the directory. 

We can then see that `-file07` is an ASCII text file. Using `cat ./file07`, we obtain the flag.
