## Writeup
The password was stored on a git repo on the server. After cloning the repo, I realised the password was not in the current readme file. I figured it might have been in an older commit version used the following commands to rollback to a previous commit version to obtain the flag. 

```
git log
git checkout <commit-version>
```
